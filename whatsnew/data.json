Pre-loading now opens stories much faster and with the new default in-app browser you never need to leave breaking to read a story.<br><br>We're also introducing something we've wanted forever: the 'hot' badge. Harnessing the community of Breaking users, we are now able to highlight stories in your feeds that are popular with other users. If one of your stories has a little orange flame icon next to the title, it means that other Breaking users found this story interesting.<br><br>We're listening to feedback and constantly trying to improve your experience of reading the news. One big challenge with the widget has been how and when to properly handle loading of new stories without running out of (limited!) memory. In the last version we switched to background fetching and some people have experienced it as not always being 100% up to date. Unacceptable! In this version we've reworked it again to combine background fetching with a new and optimized direct load. It should ensure that news in the widget are always as recent as possible.<br><br>What's new in 1.5:<br>- Choose to open stories inside Breaking in the new custom in-app browser.<br>- New 'Hot' Badge appears on stories in your feeds that other Breaking users found interesting.<br>- Preloading stories increase the speed in which we are able to show a story.<br>- New reworked loading should improve freshness of widget stories.<br>- The entire application has been localized to German, Japanese and Chinese.<br>- Fixed a bug where sharing news to Facebook or Twitter didn't work when initiated from the widget.<br>- Fixed a bug where story extracts wasn't shown on the iPad<br>- Various bug fixes and improvements."
